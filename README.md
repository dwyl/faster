# faster

Helps you ***develop*** node.js web apps/sites ***faster***
by ***automatically re-loading*** any page,  
in ***all connected browsers*** each time ***any file*** in your project is ***updated***.


## Why?

We needed a *simpler* way of reloading the "page" when
files (views/styles/data) changes in our project.  
See: https://github.com/ideaq/time/issues/81

We tried using [**nodemon**](https://github.com/ideaq/faster/issues/1)
but found it lacking in two key areas:

**a**. New files/folders added to the project were not watched.  
**b**. We still had to *manually* refresh each connected client each time.

So, instead of trying to force an *existing* ***general purpose*** tool
to do the thing that we wanted, we decided to write our own ***specific*** script.

## What?


The **simplest** way to ensure the page(s) on *all* connected devices re-load
when ever **any file** or directory is updated (created, changed or deleted) in the project.

###Â Key Benefits

+ Watches *all* directories and sub-directories (recursively) for any change
+ Responds to *any change* in the files (create, update, delete, re-name.)
+ **Notifies all connected clients** there has been a change so they can re-fresh
their content.
+ Boots *separate* WebSocket server (from your project) so no attaching required
(no conflict with existing scripts)
+ Runs the script defined in your `npm run` command as normal


## Usage

Install and save a *development dependency*:

```sh
npm install faster --save-dev
```
Then add the following line to your `scripts` in `package.json`.

```js
"faster":"./node_modules/bin/faster.js"
```

And then run the command on your local machine using:

```sh
npm run faster
```


### Note: *faster* *Expects* you to have a `start` script in package.json

If you do not have an [**npm start**](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/start) script,
add one to your package.json *now*!
(it tells other developers how to run your project).

### No Global Install Required

We hate it when module authors *require* ***global*** installation,
so we encourage you to install this module *locally* to your app


## Development *ONLY*

*Please* do not use this in Production.
(The Socket.io server on port 4242)

To *prevent* ***accidental*** running of this script in Prod,
the client script only works when the `url` matches **localhost** or **127.0.0.1**.

## *NOT* "General Purpose" (Yet!)

Right now, this script is *very* specific

+ Watch: https://www.npmjs.com/package/watch
(does *half* the job we want, but does not refresh connected devices/browsers)
